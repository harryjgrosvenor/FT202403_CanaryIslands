# Git repository for python analysis of the csv data output from the BME280 sensors

# We have collected data from the BME280 sensors over the course of the field trip. We have collected temperature, humidity, pressure and altitude as a function of pressure with respect to time. We have alsocollected GPS data during the trip, however this initially comes from a seperate file so we need to merge the datasets before analysis.

# We have written basic code for producing some of the figures that may be of interest. These exmaples include looking at the temperature variable within a few different graphical outputs, including timeseries and mapping. We can change the variables outputted in the figures and we can alter the time analysed to zoom in on specific activities.
